        <h4 class="guide-title ">Why Learn Hacking?</h4>
        <p class="guide-body">Not to be confused with malicious “black hat” hacking, ethical “white hat” hacking (also
          called penetration testing) identifies network security vulnerabilities and patch security holes before anyone
          can abuse them. <br /> <br />
          If you don’t understand how black hat hackers could get into your systems, you’re going to have a hard time
          securing them. Learning how to hack can help you implement the strongest possible security practices. It’s as
          much about finding and fixing security vulnerabilities as it is about anticipating them. Learning about the
          methods hackers use to infiltrate systems will help you resolve issues before they become dangerous. <br />
          <br />
          Above everything else, successful ethical hacking requires being a master at problem solving. Understanding
          how computer systems and programming languages work is also essential because it’s easier to anticipate ways
          to exploit the system. <br />
        </p>
        <h4 class="guide-title ">Importance of Ethical Hacking</h4>
        <p class="guide-body">
          No business or government agency can run without computers and networks. Information and computer technology
          (ICT) is one of the primary requirements everywhere. However, the much the dependency on technology is
          growing, the more the vulnerability is increasing. Everywhere there is fear of cyber crime. It may be a
          terrorist organization or a gang of bad guys; it can steal your data, loot your financial assets, and hijack
          your website and so on. Once hacked, it’s almost impossible to get the damages recovered. This is why system
          and network security should be at the first place.<br /> <br />
          Hackers attack every 38 seconds. The worldwide financial loss due to cyber attack is going to be $ 155 million
          by 2020. 68% of networks are yet unprotected. These are few of the reasons why ethical hacking is important.
          Ethical hackers can save the businesses and governments from immeasurable losses.<br />

        <h4 class="guide-title ">The job of a pentester</h4>
        <p class="guide-body">
          The job of an ethical hacker or a pentester is to test the security of a particular application
          or a network to find security vulnerabilities so that they can be patched and not be misused with.
          Here is an example of how a basic penetration test goes: <br /> <br />

        </p>
        <h4 class="guide-title ">Why take it as your career</h4>
        <p class="guide-body">
          Ethical Hacking has a lot of scope as a whole. It may have more or less of an impact in the country in
          which you're living, but it is indeed important. It is a high paying job provided you have a few years
          of experience. It estimates at around $120,000 a year. As of Jan 19, 2020, the average monthly pay for an
          Ethical Hacker in the United States is $9,983 a month. <br /> <br />
          Hence the demand for ethical hackers and security professionals is constantly increasing.

          This guide is made for beginners or people who are just getting started with hacking
          and security. Go ahead and subscibe to our newsletter in our <a href=contact.html>contact</a>
          page. You will receive timely updates on our new guides and articles. As the techniques 
          will eventually get old, new protocols are a must, as we must think as someone
          with malicious intent.
